# Journey Planner

As part of our CSC1008 module, we were tasked to create a journey planner for the Singapore Public Transport System, utilizing data structures and algorithms taught to us. In this Journey Planner application, we utilized Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm and Breadth-First-Search (BFS) to find possible paths a person can take for their journey.
